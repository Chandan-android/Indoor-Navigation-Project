# Indoor-Navigation-Project
An Indoor Navigation web application which is used to track particular location inside a campus.
Here I created a web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to track the location or particular room inside a college campus.
I have used HTML for designing the structure of the webpage and I have used CSS for designing the webpage.
I have used Javascript for doing interactions in web page and also for getting data.
In this project I have created 2D map of our college using CAD which can show the direction for any location inside a campus.
I have created multiple 2D maps which shows different location and with the help of Javascript I retrived the data whenever navigation request is made.
This project can also be modified by implementing April Tags inside a campus and tracking them using webcam and some applications.
